# Description

- Objective: Get the highest score.
- Lose: Get touched by an enemy
- Risk/reward: Get points by staying near an enemy, up to a fixed amount per enemy
- Progression:
  - Surprise:
    - Score: Every X seconds, a new enemy appears
    - Area: Every Y seconds: the game area becomes bigger
    - Ideas:
      - Positive? powers?
      - Negative? obstacles?
      - Neutral? Every Z seconds: the game area changes
  - Balancing:
    - The game should become harder and harder, up to an impossible state. But balancing should "force" the player to make a mistake and fail earlier.
    - To skip early "easy" levels, the player can use a currency to buy the "Surprise" elements.
    - The score should be "replayable", there should not be a balancing difference from skipping early levels.
